# Responses API Implementation Changelog

## Version 2.0.0 - Complete Implementation

### Journey Timeline

#### Phase 1: Initial Setup
- Created ResponsesApiV2Transformer class
- Set up basic request/response transformation
- Configured routing for Responses API models

#### Phase 2: Content Type Issues
**Problem**: `tool_result` and `tool_use` not supported by Responses API

**Fix**:
- Transformed `tool_result` → `input_text` with structured format
- Transformed `tool_use` → `output_text` with structured format
- Updated message transformation pipeline

#### Phase 3: Premature Termination
**Problem**: Models stopping after single tool call

**Fix**:
- Discovered `finish_reason: 'tool_calls'` means "stop and wait"
- Changed to `finish_reason: 'stop'` for continuation
- Added intelligent decision logic

#### Phase 4: Continuous Execution
**Problem**: Multi-step tasks not completing

**Solution**:
- Added `continuousExecution` configuration option
- Added `alwaysContinueWithTools` configuration option
- Implemented `shouldContinue()` detection method
- Default: aggressive continuation enabled

#### Phase 5: Streaming Improvements
**Problem**: Stream events terminating early

**Fix**:
- Delayed finish_reason until `response.completed`
- Track state throughout stream
- Enhanced buffering and state management

#### Phase 6: O-Series Optimization
**Enhancement**: Special handling for reasoning models
- Remove temperature parameter
- Add reasoning.effort parameter
- Allocate extra tokens (10k for o4, 5k for o3)
- Detect reasoning models automatically

### Files Modified
1. `/Users/jerry/llms/src/transformer/responses-api-v2.transformer.ts` - Main implementation
2. `/Users/jerry/llms/src/types/responses-api.types.ts` - Type definitions
3. `/Users/jerry/.claude-code-router/config.json` - Configuration
4. `/Users/jerry/ccr/CLAUDE.md` - Documentation updates

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Full tool support (single, parallel, sequential)
- ✅ Continuous autonomous execution
- ✅ Multi-turn conversation preservation
- ✅ Reasoning model optimization
- ✅ Configurable behavior
- ✅ Production-ready error handling

### Lessons Learned
1. OpenAI's `finish_reason` semantics are counterintuitive
2. Content type compatibility is critical
3. Continuous execution should be default behavior
4. Streaming requires careful state management
5. Reasoning models need special handling
